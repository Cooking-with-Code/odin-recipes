  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>You don't need a fancy ice cream maker to make ice cream at home. All you need is a plastic baggie and 15 minutes. Top with any of your favorite topping and enjoy homemade ice cream instantly! If we had known making your own ice cream was this easy we would have started making it a long time ago!</p>
<p>To customize you can change up the extract or add in a little chocolate syrup before you start shaking. We also love folding in chopped Oreos or Reeses after. If you want your ice cream a little firmer, place it in an airtight container in the freezer before serving. </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 c. half-and-half</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 c. ice</li>
    <li>1/3 c. kosher salt</li>
    <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small resealable plastic bag, combine half-and-half, sugar, and vanilla. Push out excess air and seal.</li>
    <li>Into a large resealable plastic bag, combine ice and salt. Place small bag inside the bigger bag and shake vigorously, 7 to 10 minutes, until ice cream has hardened.</li>
    <li>Remove from bag and enjoy with your favorite ice cream toppings.
</li>
  </ol>
